# JUnit Mockito Practicing
This Java project focuses on implementing unit tests for the `org.fed333.ticket.booking.app.service` package.

## Issues:
The following test classes need to be implemented:

* `SaveEntityValidatorTest`
* `EventServiceTest`
* `TicketServiceTest`
* `UserAccountServiceTest`
* `UserServiceTest`

## Requirements:
* All test classes must be implemented using JUnit4.
* Mockito framework must be used for object mocking.
* AssertJ Core assertion library must be used for assertions.
* Test coverage for the service package must be equal to 100%.
* All implementations of test methods must follow the specified naming convention.

## Pay attention
The project already contains all necessary dependencies, so you are not supposed to change the `pom.xml`.
